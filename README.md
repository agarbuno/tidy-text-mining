This is a port of the original material shared by the authors of [**Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach**](http://tidytextmining.com/). 

The intention with this is to have a short tutorial on text mining following the principles of tidy data, for which Silge's and Robinson's is a great material. 

The aim is to cover the chapters:   
- 01 : Tidy text principles 
- 03 : Token frequency 
- 04 : Word combinations 
- 07 : Case study
